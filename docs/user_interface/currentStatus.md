Material design
----

In general, we try to follow the design concepts put forward by [Google Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)

Scalable design

The same design works well across a range of devices:

Depending on the resolution, the menu is either rendered as a sliding menu or as a static menu:
